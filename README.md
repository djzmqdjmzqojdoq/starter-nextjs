# Next.js Starter Template

This repository contains a custom template for quickly starting projects with Next.js, tailored to my personal needs but shared publicly for anyone who might find it useful. It includes the following features and configurations:

- **SASS** for more powerful and elegant styling.
- **react-icons** to easily incorporate icons into the application.
- **react-toastify** for adding beautiful notifications to the application.
- **lucide-react** to use a beautifully designed icon set.

## Features

- Removal of unnecessary files and features from Next.js for a lighter and clearer project structure.
- Default images have been removed to avoid bloat and allow for a more personalized start.
- `reactStrictMode` is enabled for better problem detection in React code.

## Why This Template?

I created this template to streamline the process of starting new projects with Next.js by eliminating the need to manually remove unnecessary parts and configure dependencies and features I frequently use. Although it's primarily intended for my personal use, I've made it public so it can serve as a helpful starting point for other developers.

## How to Use This Template?

To use this template, you can simply run the following command, replacing `your-new-project` with the name of your new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest your-new-project --example "https://github.com/ponerax/starter-nextjs/tree/main/"
```
